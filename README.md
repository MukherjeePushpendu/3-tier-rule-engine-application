# 3-tier-rule-engine-application
To develop a 3-tier rule engine application we need to break down the task into several steps, focusing on the data structure, storage , API design and testing.

Here's a **README.md** template for your 3-tier rule engine application using Flask, detailing the process of setting up the application, required installations, folder structure, and additional non-functional considerations like security and performance. I've crafted it to be informative, clear, and visually appealing.

# 3-Tier Rule Engine Application

## Overview

This project is a **3-tier rule engine application** developed using Flask, serving as an API layer. It follows a clear architectural separation:
- **UI Layer**: Frontend for rule input (HTML/JS).
- **API Layer**: Flask application exposing endpoints to create, combine, and evaluate rules.
- **Backend Layer**: Business logic for handling rules, parsing them, and combining them as per the use case.

## Features

- **Rule Creation**: Parse user-defined rules and convert them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Rule Combination**: Combine multiple rules for complex evaluation.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluate rules against user-provided data.

## Architecture

```plaintext
+---------------+     +----------------+     +---------------+
|   UI Layer    | --> |   API Layer    | --> |  Backend Layer |
| (HTML/JS)     |     | (Flask API)    |     | (Business Logic)|
+---------------+     +----------------+     +---------------+
```

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: Ensure you have Git installed. Download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Flask**: For setting up the API, Flask is needed.




### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/3-tier-rule-engine-application.git
cd 3-tier-rule-engine-application
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment before installing the dependencies:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

Install the Python dependencies required for the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Flask Application

To run the Flask application, use the following command:

```bash
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
```

This will start the Flask API on `localhost:5000`.

## Extensions for VSCode

To improve the development experience in **Visual Studio Code**, you can install the following extensions:

1. **Python**: Provides Python language support and IntelliSense.
2. **Flask Snippets**: Provides handy snippets for Flask development.
3. **Docker**: Helps in working with Docker and containerized environments.
4. **GitLens**: Enhance Git capabilities directly in VSCode.
   
To install these, open VSCode and navigate to the **Extensions** tab (Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for the above names.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint          | Description                        |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/create_rule`     | Creates a new rule                 |
| POST   | `/combine_rules`   | Combines multiple rules            |
| POST   | `/evaluate_rule`   | Evaluates a rule against input data|

### Example API Requests

#### Create Rule
```bash
POST /create_rule
{
  "rule": "age > 18 AND income < 50000"
}
```

#### Evaluate Rule
```bash
POST /evaluate_rule
{
  "ast": "<AST_OBJECT>",
  "data": {
    "age": 21,
    "income": 40000
  }
}
```

## Running the Application with Docker

You can run the application in a Docker container using the provided **Dockerfile**.

### Step 1: Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t rule-engine-app .
```

### Step 2: Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 rule-engine-app
```

---

## Security Considerations

To enhance the security of the application:

- **Input Validation**: Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Limit the origins allowed to access the API.
- **HTTPS**: Always use SSL/HTTPS for encrypted communication in production environments.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, etc.

### Additional Security Layers:

- **Authentication**: Implement API keys or OAuth for API access.
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limiting to avoid brute-force attacks.

## Performance Optimizations

- **Caching**: Cache frequently used rules or evaluations to reduce computational overhead.
- **Database Indexing**: If a database is used, ensure proper indexing for performance.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Implement async tasks for long-running rule evaluations to avoid blocking API responses.

---

## Bonus Points

- **Testing**: Automated tests for the API can be written using `unittest` or `pytest`.
- **CI/CD**: Set up a Continuous Integration/Deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate builds and tests.

---

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic structure for a 3-tier rule engine application using Flask. It can be extended with additional features like complex rule evaluations, dynamic rule management, and enhanced security/performance optimizations.
